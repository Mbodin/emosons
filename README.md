Screen readers tend to treat emojis in a way that does not correspond to their use in social networks.
Screen readers typically describes emojis (for instance “Slightly smiling face” for 🙂).
This is impractical as emoji description tend to be long (several words), and not actually provide the corresponding emotion, making the experience of emojis very different for blind people than to sighted people.

This project aims at providing sounds for each emoji that could be used by screen readers.
These sounds are meant to be short, and to convey an emotion for each emoji.
These sounds are non-descriptive: they typically correspond to the kind of sounds that we do when experiencing the emotion.
For instance, 🤣 will be associated to a laughing sound (instead of the description “Rolling on the Floor Laughing”).

The [raw](./raw) folder contains raw recordings, whilst the [emojis](./emojis) folder contains audio files for each emojis.
